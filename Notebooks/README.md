## Data Analysis


## Section 1

How can one isolate or group transactions of each cardholder?

- We can group the transactions by customer_id using groupby() function

Consider the time period 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.
- What are the top 100 highest transactions during this time period?
- Do you see any fraudulent or anomalous transactions?
- If you answered yes to the previous question, explain why you think there might be fraudulent transactions during this time frame.

Some fraudsters hack a credit card by making several small payments (generally less than $2.00), which are typically ignored by cardholders. Count the transactions that are less than $2.00 per cardholder. Is there any evidence to suggest that a credit card has been hacked? Explain your rationale.
